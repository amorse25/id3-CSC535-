# id3-CSC535-

Implementation of the id3 Decision Tree. A given training set was included (first training set: "training_data") and
a selected training set (second training set: "training_data_1") which was derived from 
https://www.kaggle.com/fredericobreno/play-tennis. Information gain and entropy were used in this implementation to 
determine splitting points in the tree based on the dataset.
